      <h2 class = "iq-vs-eq-title">What is IQ and EQ?</h2>
      <p class = "eq-content">
        <b>Intelligence Quotient (IQ):</b>  IQ is a score derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess intelligence. Relates directly to intellectual pursuits such as the ability to learn as well as understand and apply information to skill sets. 
        IQ covers logical reasoning, word comprehension and math skills. People with high IQ can think in abstracts and make connections by making generalizations faster.
      </p>
        
      <div class = "eq">
        <p class = "eq-content">
          <b>Emotional Quotient (EQ):</b>Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behaviour and relationships.
           EQ refers to an individual’s ability to perceive, control, evaluate and express emotions. People with high EQ can manage emotions, use their emotions to facilitate thinking, understand emotional meanings and accurately perceive other’s emotions.
        </p>
        <p class = "eq-content">
           EQ refers to emotional intelligence compared to IQ which refers to general intelligence. IQ is an inborn ability while EQ can be learned and improved. 
           IQ ensures success in school while EQ ensures success in life.
        </p>
        <p class = "eq-content">
           Emotional intelligence (EI) is important as it can lead us on the path to a fulfilled and happy life. We humans are social creatures first of all and we need to know how to interact with one another.
           The workplace is always evolving and having a high emotional intelligence can prepare us for constant change and adaptability. People with greater EI tend to succeed better as they are better equipped to work cohesively within teams, deal with change more effectively and manage stress. 
           EQ is a driver for both personal and professional lives.
        </p>
    
        <p class = "eq-content">
           EQ can be thought of as an individual’s abilities to be:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Self-Aware:</b> encompassing our own knowledge of ourselves, and being able to both recognise and understand ourselves, our behaviours, and our emotions.</li>
                <li><b>Self-Manage and Self-Regulate:</b> encompassing our ability to be in control of our emotions, and therefore our responses.</li>
                <li><b>Self-Motivated:</b> encompassing our internal resources to be driven, perform, act, and reach towards goals.</li>
                <li><b>Empathic:</b> encompassing our ability to understand and ‘feel for’ others, understand their emotion, and therefore relate to them more effectively.</li>
                <li><b>Relational:</b> encompassing our ability to build and maintain relationships, network, lead, manage conflict and work with others.</li>




            </ul>

      </div>


        <p class = "eq-summary"> 
           I have researched and have found that having a higher EQ is more important than having a high IQ not just for the workplace but for life in general. 
           I also find it important to apply and practice mindfulness which can benefit us greatly. Having a strong understanding on what is going on around you and knowing what to do is such an underrated skill people don’t talk about enough. 
           How can we understand others when we can’t even understand ourselves?
