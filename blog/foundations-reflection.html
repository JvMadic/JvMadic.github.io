            <ul>
                <li class = "reflections-question">
                    What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
                </li>
                <p class = "reflections-content">
                    One thing I learnt about myself is that I can push myself to being outside my comfort zone and be okay with it. I found some exercises to be real challenging and myself being lost but I’ve adapted the mindset that 
                    “I will figure out the answer in due time and to trust the process”. 
                    I’ve learnt how important getting exercise is for me and how much it helps with coding. During days I went to the gym, I found myself to have a clearer mind compared to rest days I don’t go to the gym.
                     I’m not sure if it is related or not but, I have found myself to be more chill these days in terms of not getting phased by things that easily. Maybe because I am in a stressed zone at times during coding, 
                     I think my mind is adapting to  not let things get to me that easily.
                </p>
                <li class = "reflections-question">
                    What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
                </li>
                <p class = "reflections-content">
                    I think all these elements are super important during learning and programming. When we let go of our egos, we let ourselves learn fully as we allow ourselves to fail and grow during these times of learning instead of pretending knowing what we are doing when we don’t. 
                    When we are self-aware, it gives us the chance to look at ourselves from a different point of view, this allows us to think differently which is important when learning programming. 
                </p>
                <li class = "reflections-question">
                    What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
                </li>
                <p class = "reflections-content">
                    I was surprised when I learnt how difficult active listening was during the listening and looping exercises. I found it difficult not to reply to someone straightaway when they were talking to me and to answer them after they said everything they needed to say. 
                </p>
                <li class = "reflections-question">
                    What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
                </li>
                <p class = "reflections-content">
                    It was challenging during the listening and looping as I found it difficult not to reply back to someone and remembering everything they said when I had to say it back to them. 
                    It’s hard for me to process so much information at one time and say it back as I lose some specific details. I am definitely working on active listening and looping.
                </p>
                <li class = "reflections-question">
                    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
                </li>
                <p class = "reflections-content">
                    Because having soft skills is important in the workplace not just the tech industry. A lot more places should adapt in teaching these core skills as they just make you into a better human being. Since we work in teams,
                    we interact with each other a lot which is why it is important to get along with our team mates.
                </p>
                <li class = "reflections-question">
                    Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.
                </li>
                <p class = "reflections-content">
                    No as I enjoyed learning the core content. I felt that the core content has helped me mould my mindset into a better one, adapting the growth mindset and working on my emotional intelligence. 
                    Working on the core content also gave me some time to reflect and step away from the programming parts which is good as I need to step back and think about what I was doing. This process helps solidify my learning I felt.
