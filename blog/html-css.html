    <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border and Padding?</h2>
    </div>

    <img src = "https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cc37136926d109ac1d5e261a6a07df94.webp" rel = "Pic of margin, border and padding" class = "margin-border-padding">

    <div class ="padding"> 
        <h3>Padding</h3>
        <p>Padding is the space between the content and the border. It is the space between the content and the border. In this example, we can see that the content has padding of 10px on the left and right sides and have a padding of 15px for both top and bottom sides. The padding either grows or shrinks the elements size.</p>

    </div>

    <div class ="margin">
        <h3>Margin</h3>
        <p>Margin is the space outside the border of an element. Margin defines the space from this border to the next outer element. Since the margin is the space outside the border, the margin can be used to “push away” other elements. In the example below, each element has a margin of 10 pixels. Margins are used to create whitespace between elements which give them room to breathe.</p>
        <img src = "https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Update%20css%20margin%20vs%20padding.png?width=500&name=Update%20css%20margin%20vs%20padding.png" rel = "Picture of margin" class = "margin-image">
    </div>

    <div class = "border">
        <h3>Border</h3>
        <p>The border is the space between the padding and the margin. By default, the border does not have any width but can be set one using the CSS border property. The border style can be changed to many styles including the border width just like in the image below. </p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=773/net/uploads/legacy/2027_borders/images/border-width.jpg" rel = "border coding" class = "border-image">
    </div>

    <div class = "padding-margin-summary"> 
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>So the difference between margin and padding is that while padding deals with the inner space (the space between an element content and the border), margin deals with the outer space (the space outside of the element) to the next outer element.

            Thus, padding and margin have crucial differences that allows them to play key roles in styling a web page.</p>
