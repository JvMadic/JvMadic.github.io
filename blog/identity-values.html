            <h2 class ="identity-title">Who am I?</h2>
            <p class = "identity-content">I am JV. Who I am today is a person who is looking for purpose. I am a person who wants to make a positive difference, this is why I studied Environmental Science and that my previous role was in ecological restoration. During that time, my goal was to give back to nature and to preserve our taonga. A goal I share with my partner is buying and settling on old farm land and regrowing/revegetating back the land to restore native bush. I want to give back to the community by sharing my knowledge with ecological restoration and helping out practically. </p>
            <p class = "identity-content"> I like helping others out, I get a sense of fulfilment when others and people I care about achieve their goals. I think I am a caring person; I’d like to think that I would always put others before myself in situations. I’m a strong believer in treating others with respect and always trying to see the good in others.</p>

            <h2 class = "str-title">Strengths:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class = "str-list"><b>Empathy:</b> I like to put myself in others people’s shoes and see from their POV. I like understanding other people’s views and how they think. </li>
                <li class = "str-list"><b>Honesty:</b> I hate lying, I am a bad liar. I like being honest with everyone even if it means telling them the harsh truth. There’s too much bullshit in the world and too many lies and fake things, this may be a reason for why I seek and value truth.</li>
                <li class = "str-list"><b>Can see the bigger picture/Deep thinker:</b> I like thinking in a philosophical manner and always think of the bigger picture. I tend to ask the question why a lot because I want to understand things at a deeper level. Why are things the way they are. </li>
                <li class = "str-list"><b>Always craving knowledge:</b> I love learning new things which is why I am also doing this course. I am a person that gets bored easily and believe that we learn new things all throughout our lifetime. I think I got taught this mindset from a young age by my grandparents. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class = "wkn-title">Weaknesses:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class = "wkn-list"><b>Too hard on myself:</b> Sometimes I think that I am too hard on myself. I criticize myself for not achieving or understanding things even though I know that people learn/work on different levels. I wouldn’t say I have high expectations for myself but I definitely do have expectations. I find it hard to forgive myself sometimes when I make a mistake. </li>
                <li class = "wkn-list"><b>Afraid to fail:</b> I was always afraid to fail which stopped me from trying new things and getting better at them. I only realised in the last couple of years that failing at something is the first step to succeeding in it. This weakness stems from me being too hard on myself.</li>
                <li class = "wkn-list"><b>Perfectionist/OCD/Lack of fluidity:</b> I am a creature of habit. I don’t have OCD but maybe just a little bit. I like things to be organized and have some sort of schedule for the day/week. I dislike having my schedule disrupted and find it hard getting back on track sometimes. I am definitely working on being more fluid.  I like being in control of myself and my environment as it is the only thing, I have control over. One of my favourite </li>
