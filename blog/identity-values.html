                I am JV. Who I am today is a person who is looking for purpose. I am a person who wants to make a positive difference, 
                this is why I studied Environmental Science and that my previous role was in ecological restoration. 
                During that time, my goal was to give back to nature and to preserve our taonga. A goal I share with my partner is buying and settling on old farm land and regrowing/revegetating back the land to restore native bush. 
                I want to give back to the community by sharing my knowledge with ecological restoration and helping out practically. 
            </p>
            <p class = "identity-content"> 
                I like helping others out, I get a sense of fulfilment when others and people I care about achieve their goals. I think I am a caring person; 
                I’d like to think that I would always put others before myself in situations. I’m a strong believer in treating others with respect and always trying to see the good in others.

                    <li class = "str-list"><b>Honesty:</b> I hate lying, I am a bad liar. I like being honest with everyone even if it means telling them the harsh truth. There’s too much bullshit in the world and too many lies and fake things, this may be a reason for why I seek and value truth.</li>
                    <li class = "str-list"><b>Can see the bigger picture/Deep thinker:</b> I like thinking in a philosophical manner and always think of the bigger picture. I tend to ask the question why a lot because I want to understand things at a deeper level. Why are things the way they are. </li>
                    <li class = "str-list"><b>Always craving knowledge:</b> I love learning new things which is why I am also doing this course. I am a person that gets bored easily and believe that we learn new things all throughout our lifetime. I think I got taught this mindset from a young age by my grandparents. </li>

I criticize myself for not achieving or understanding things even though I know that people learn/work on different levels. I wouldn’t say I have high expectations for myself but I definitely do have expectations. I find it hard to forgive myself sometimes when I make a mistake. </li>
                <li class = "wkn-list"><b>Afraid to fail:</b> I was always afraid to fail which stopped me from trying new things and getting better at them. I only realised in the last couple of years that failing at something is the first step to succeeding in it. This weakness stems from me being too hard on myself.</li>
                <li class = "wkn-list"><b>Perfectionist/OCD/Lack of fluidity:</b> I am a creature of habit. I don’t have OCD but maybe just a little bit. I like things to be organized and have some sort of schedule for the day/week. I dislike having my schedule disrupted and find it hard getting back on track sometimes. I am definitely working on being more fluid.  I like being in control of myself and my environment as it is the only thing, I have control over. One of my favourite </li>

                    JV is quiet, funny and caring. He always remembers special occasions. I remember him as a young boy, he would save up his allowance to buy me a gift/present and even buy me chocolates for valentine’s day.
                    He cares a lot for family and friends. He is very friendly, makes friends easily and approachable. His friends come to him for advice and help. 
                    He’s had the same group of friends since intermediate, he’s a good friend to have. I think he is tough in regards to backing and standing up for himself. 
                    He is cheap but generous. He doesn’t buy unnecessary things for himself as he thinks about the future. He is very interested in nature and the natural environment.

                    If I was to describe Jayvee in one line, it would be that he is a big guy with an even bigger heart. Somewhat introverted, yet at the same time able to warm the space around him with his open, completely unjudging nature. 
                    He prioritises family and his day ones above all else, and always lets those who he cares about know that he cares, and just how much. 
                    Mutual respect and loyalty are core values which he wears on his sleeve. Jayvee is as happy to be on an adventure somewhere in our great outdoors as he is bingeing way too many shows at once on Netflix. 
                    Ever since playing with ants and elephant beetles, and being inspired by Captain Planet as a kid, Jayvee has cared about our planet and the creatures who call it home. 
                    We all have our own demons, yet, Jayvee has proven that through personal growth and perseverance, these can be overcome - not to say that he’s perfect! ;)

            <h2 class = "questions-title">Identity questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class = "question"> Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</li>
                <p class = "answer"> 
                    In my previous role, I was a Team Leader for an Ecological Restoration Team. This meant hard physical work most days. 
                    I had one team member who, not only struggled with the work but also disliked it. My ethical dilemmas was “do I tell the big boss about this person’s work quality” and “do I talk to this person about their work quality”. 
                    As a team leader it is my job to talk to both the boss and the team member but it didn’t make talking to either about the problem any easier. 
                    I ended up talking to the team member first and asking about what they are feeling and their thoughts about this type of work. 
                    I told them that this sort of work is hard (both physical and mentally taxing) and said that not everyone is cut out for this job and would even enjoy it. 
                    I told them that I am here to help them out as much as I can and help them appreciate why we do this sort of work. 
                </p>
                <p class = "answer"> 
                    A couple months have passed but the quality of work for this team member has not improved but actually dropped even further. 
                    This is when I decided to talk to the boss as it has affected the whole team. The team basically had to pick up this persons weight and work even harder. 
                    Our work relies on team work and there were tight deadlines on sites to be finished. I told the boss about how this person has been working, 
                    about how I tried my best in helping them and how they have affected the team morale. My boss was appreciated with me telling them about this person and in the end they ended up leaving on their own decision. 
                    My worry was that that team member would get mad at me for reporting to the boss on their work even though reporting back to the boss was part of my job. 
                    I truly hate conflict and would rather solve the problem right when it occurs. I tried my best to help that individual but the job was just not fit for them. 
                    I’m happy they left on their own will and avoided the situation where the boss talked to them about their performance.

                <li class = "question"> Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</li>
                <p class = "answer"> 
                    I am Filipino and I grew up in the Philippines. I moved to New Zealand when I was 10 years old which is great because I got to experience growing up in both places. 
                    As you know, the Philippines is a third world country with a lot of poverty. I grew up witnessing this which made me more thankful and appreciative for what I have. 
                    I think this is also why I am empathetic as I know that people come from different backgrounds and have different point of views. 
                    The Filipino culture has a strong sense of being family oriented. Children tend to stay and live at the family home in order to look after their parents when they get older and even give their parents money not in terms of paying rent or anything, 
                    but as a way of appreciation and looking after them. I definitely have a strong connection to my family but I also have adapted the Western way of living so I’d like to think I am a good mix of both things.

                <li class = "question"> Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development </li>
                <p class = "answer"> 
                    I think I will do well working on the group projects as I like working in a team. I love collaborating and hearing everyone’s ideas. I believe that there is no “dumb idea”. 
                    For my personal learning, I need to remind myself to not be too hard on myself and just take it one day at a time and to learn in a steady pace. 
                    I need to believe and back myself up that I can do it and learn these new things. In terms of career development, I definitely see myself working in a team as I thrive in team environments. 
                    Ultimately though, I do want to work remotely as I want to live somewhere remote, surrounded by bush or in a place where I can enhance and bring back the bush.

                <li class = "question"> Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</li>
                <p class = "answer"> 
                    I think being a deep thinker will help me with my learning. I like taking a step back and looking at things from a different perspective. 
                    I also think that my honesty can help, in terms of being honest with myself. I know when I am truly stuck and am not afraid to ask for help. 
                </p>
                    
                <li class = "question"> Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</li>
                <p class = "answer"> 
                    As mentioned before, I was a team leader for an ecological restoration company. There were times where my team members had low motivation/low productivity and were resistant. 
                    It definitely takes a lot for me to bring morale and productivity up because during those times, I too can admit having low motivation. 
                    A lot of the time it was due to everyone being fatigued since it was a very physical job.
                </p>
                <p class = "answer">  
                    As a leader, it was my job to bring everyone back up and get the ball rolling again. I would do this by creating a good environment for everyone, I do this through making lots of jokes, 
                    having banter with the team, longer breaks (as long as the job gets done), basically anything to liven up the mood. I did things like buy coffees for everyone, 
                    pizzas or a box of beer on Fridays, I honestly did not mind spending a little bit of my own money to motivate or create a better environment for everyone. 
                    What is a couple of dollars compared to working with a happier and more motivated team?
