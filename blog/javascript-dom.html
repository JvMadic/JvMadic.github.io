            <h2 class = "analogy-title">Use an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and Javascript</h2>
            <p class = "java-content">
                An analogy we can use is to compare the HTML, CSS and Javascript to the human anatomy. We can think of HTML as the skeleton and backbone of the body as it is needed for structure. 
                CSS is like parts of the body we can style and change, for example, hair. We can have different hairstyles and hair colours just like how there is many styles and colours that can be used for CSS. 
                Lastly, we can think of Javascript to be the brain and nervous system as we use it to make things work and make things happen. We use our brain give action to parts of our bodies just like how Javascript is used for making things happen on web pages.

        <div class = "control-container">
            <h2 class = "control-title">Explain control flow and loops</h2>
            <p class = "java-content">
                A control flow is the order in which code is executed. The control flow is executed in a top-down manner and are executed according to the order in which they appear. 
                Although, there are statements that can be used to control the flow, these are called control flow statements. We can think of control flow like following a recipe in a book. 
                First you grab your ingredients, then you prepare them in various ways then you cook the food. 
            </p>
            <p class = "java-content">
                Loops work by carrying out a task a specific number of times. The loops work until a given conditional statement has been met. 
                We can think of loops like practicing shooting a basketball. Back then, I used to finish my training sessions with shooting and making a basket a certain number of times. 
                For example, one day I would set myself the goal of not going home until I’ve sunk the ball at least 50 times. 
                In this example I’ve used, the loop would be shooting the ball and the condition is making 50 made baskets.

        <div class = "dom-container">
            <h2 class = "dom-title">What is the DOM?</h2>
            <p class = "java-content">
                The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language independent, application programming interface (API) that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure where each node is an object representing a part of the document. 
                The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.  When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object. 
                The document object is the root node of the HTML document. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree for JavaScript. With them, we can change the document’s structure, style or content.

        <div class = "arrays-conntainer">
            <h2 class = "arrays-title">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
            <p class="java-content"> 
                Objects are used to represent a “thing” in code. It could be a person, a car, a book – basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. 
                In objects, these characteristics are called properties which consist of a key and value. For example: take my name for example. ‘Name’ would be the key and ‘value’ would be Jayvee.
            </p>
            <p class = "java-content">
                Arrays are used to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are useful when creating ordered collections as items in the collection are accessed by their numerical position on the list. 
                If you wanted to grab something from the array, you would call it by using its numerical order in the array.

        <div class = "functions-container">
            <h2 class = "functions-title">Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h2>
            <p class = "java-content">
                Functions are self-contained code that can perform a specific task. They can be written to perform different kinds of tasks. 
                For example, you can write a function to add all the numbers in an array. Sure, we can write code to add the numbers individually, but functions are used as they make it easier to perform certain tasks. 
                Functions keep things organised and can handle more complex tasks that could be very time consuming i.e., sorting a list with more than 1000 items in alphabetical order.
