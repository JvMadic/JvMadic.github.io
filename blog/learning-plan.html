             I think I learn the best is when I have a structured guideline or a curriculum to follow. EDA has this covered which is great. I’m not very good at learning things on my own, which is why I am studying with EDA.
             I like learning in a positive environment and learning together along with others, which is why I can’t wait until bootcamp starts. I have learnt this during my time at university, I like working and collaborating with others, 
             I also find it very important having people around you that can support you when you get lost or need help. I know that the facilitators will be of great help when I am in need of help or support.
          </p>
          <p class = "learning-content"> 
             The way that I have treated course work so far is that I think of is as a full-time job. I work for 8 hours a day (or try to) during the morning till the afternoon. So far, I have been going to the gym first thing in the morning,
             which gets it out of the way and leaves me to just focus on work. 
             I know this will be difficult to do when bootcamp starts which means I will have to adjust my schedule and exercise after course.  I like working on the course work during the weekdays as I like to leave my weekends for my personal time.
             This doesn’t mean that I won’t work weekends as I know I will be in the future when course work becomes more challenging.
          </p>
          <p class = "learning-content">
             Personal weaknesses that can hinder my learning are: being too hard on myself and being afraid to fail. I have always been too hard on myself; I tend to forget that people learn things at different paces and sometimes 
             criticize myself for not understanding something straight away. 
             I find it hard sometimes to forgive myself when I do something wrong. I also have terrible mindset of being afraid to fail. This is a reason that has stopped me from trying new things and even succeeding in them.
             I am only at the second week of foundations but I still can’t help feeling anxious at times as I am thinking “What did I get myself into?”, even though the course work has been really manageable so far. 
             I just need to keep reminding myself to look at it “one day at a time” and too just keep pushing and persisting. I will keep working on both of my weaknesses and manifest a better mindset.
          </p>
          <p class = "learning-content">
             I have mentioned that I like working with others but during bootcamp, I think I will need to be left to my own devices at times as I take a while to get into the ‘zone’.
             The main thing for me is to not get distracted in order to fully give 100% to my work. It also depends on the type of work I am doing, if it is group work then I am giving my full attention to my team. 
             When I feel like things are building up or starting to get to me, this is when I will talk to someone and ask for help. I am someone who is not afraid to ask for help from others. When I’m stuck on something,
             I usually try to figure it out on my own for a while but sometimes I can take too long and waste time. I need to find a point where I have tried as hard as I can looking for the solution and when to ask for help as I want to minimize time wasted. 
             I want to say something like 30 minutes would be sufficient time for finding a solution before asking for help.

             A non-technical human skill I want to get out of EDA is having a growth mindset. Not just growth in knowledge but also in developing personally and professionally. 
             I want to have the mindset to keep wanting to grow as a person. I want to learn to fall in love with the struggle of not understanding something as it is the first step to learning. 
             I want to have the mindset of wanting to learn new things tech related even when I’ve been working in the web development field for a while.

             My future goal is to be able to work remotely from home as I plan to live somewhere away from the cities. I want the luxury of being immersed in nature while still being connected to society. 
             I want to be financially stable as I want to own land and property so that I can plant and bring back native bush wherever I end up at. 
             I want to progress my career to becoming a software developer after working in web development for a while.

            <li class= "update-questions">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</li>
            <p class ="update-answers">
              My long term goal is to work for a company that benefits the environment in some way or help promote sustainability. 
              In the future, I wish to work towards being a software developer. My goal is to be able to work remotely from home when I live out of the city somewhere. 
            </p>
            <li class= "update-questions">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</li>
            <p class ="update-answers">
               I think the limitation I have mentioned earlier which was “being too hard on myself” might be a factor during the bootcamp. I noticed that during this foundation course, 
               I did catch myself being hard on myself. I felt frustrated at times but I am definitely getting better at it. I learnt during this foundations that it is good to step back and re evaluate my situation. 
               I also learnt that the solutions for the problem I am facing will reveal itself in due time and that I should just trust the process. One other limitation I definitely will face is scheduling my time for the gym. 
               During the foundations I found myself to be going to the gym before or in the middle of my course work as a break, and have found this to be really good for clearing my mind. I will need a strong mindset of having to go after course even if my brain is fried and I am tired.
               This will definitely be a battle for me. 
            </p>
            <li class= "update-questions">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</li>
            <p class ="update-answers">
              I think staying focused and on top of the workload will be a big challenge. I will work around this by focusing on course work and scheduling proper time for doing it. 
              I also need to not be overwhelmed at these times as a negative mindset proves to be detrimental for my drive to learn.
            </p>
            <li class= "update-questions">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</li>
            <p class ="update-answers">
              I would like to improve more on my self awareness and reflective skills. I want to be able to actively listen to people and truly understand what they are trying to tell me. 
              I want to keep working on developing a growth mindset and I want to continue learning lots of new things after this course ends.
            </p>
            <li class= "update-questions">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>
            <p class ="update-answers">
               My expectations of bootcamp will be a social and helpful environment where asking questions is encouraged. 
               I know that I will struggle with some of the technical work I will be learning but I also know that there are lots of people there to help me out which is reassuring. 
            </p>
            <li class= "update-questions">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</li>
            <p class ="update-answers">
               I expect myself to be present at all times and really take in what is being taught to me. I want to get to know my cohort and get along with them and form a good support system with one another.  
               If I am stuck with a problem, I will try to ask for help after trying to solve it for maybe around 20 mins. This way, I want to limit wasting my time trying to solve it and get help instead.
            </p>
            <p class ="update-answers">
               Being at a learning environment will help me with focusing as it is way different to being at home. It will almost be like being at uni again. 
               I will manage my workload by statying focused and sticking to the timeboxes, if I have to work over these times then I will do it even if it means working on the weekend. 
               I will keep going until the work is done. I am happy to help my fellow students if they ask me and I hope they too will help me out in return.
