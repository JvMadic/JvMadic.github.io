        <div class = "learning-content-container">
          <p class = "learning-content"> I think I learn the best is when I have a structured guideline or a curriculum to follow. EDA has this covered which is great. I’m not very good at learning things on my own, which is why I am studying with EDA. I like learning in a positive environment and learning together along with others, which is why I can’t wait until bootcamp starts. I have learnt this during my time at university, I like working and collaborating with others, I also find it very important having people around you that can support you when you get lost or need help. I know that the facilitators will be of great help when I am in need of help or support.</p>
          <p class = "learning-content"> The way that I have treated course work so far is that I think of is as a full-time job. I work for 8 hours a day (or try to) during the morning till the afternoon. So far, I have been going to the gym first thing in the morning, which gets it out of the way and leaves me to just focus on work. I know this will be difficult to do when bootcamp starts which means I will have to adjust my schedule and exercise after course.  I like working on the course work during the weekdays as I like to leave my weekends for my personal time. This doesn’t mean that I won’t work weekends as I know I will be in the future when course work becomes more challenging. </p>
          <p class = "learning-content"> Personal weaknesses that can hinder my learning are: being too hard on myself and being afraid to fail. I have always been too hard on myself; I tend to forget that people learn things at different paces and sometimes criticize myself for not understanding something straight away. I find it hard sometimes to forgive myself when I do something wrong. I also have terrible mindset of being afraid to fail. This is a reason that has stopped me from trying new things and even succeeding in them. I am only at the second week of foundations but I still can’t help feeling anxious at times as I am thinking “What did I get myself into?”, even though the course work has been really manageable so far. I just need to keep reminding myself to look at it “one day at a time” and too just keep pushing and persisting. I will keep working on both of my weaknesses and manifest a better mindset.</p>
          <p class = "learning-content"> I have mentioned that I like working with others but during bootcamp, I think I will need to be left to my own devices at times as I take a while to get into the ‘zone’. The main thing for me is to not get distracted in order to fully give 100% to my work. It also depends on the type of work I am doing, if it is group work then I am giving my full attention to my team. When I feel like things are building up or starting to get to me, this is when I will talk to someone and ask for help. I am someone who is not afraid to ask for help from others. When I’m stuck on something, I usually try to figure it out on my own for a while but sometimes I can take too long and waste time. I need to find a point where I have tried as hard as I can looking for the solution and when to ask for help as I want to minimize time wasted. I want to say something like 30 minutes would be sufficient time for finding a solution before asking for help.</p>
          <p class = "learning-content"> A non-technical human skill I want to get out of EDA is having a growth mindset. Not just growth in knowledge but also in developing personally and professionally. I want to have the mindset to keep wanting to grow as a person. I want to learn to fall in love with the struggle of not understanding something as it is the first step to learning. I want to have the mindset of wanting to learn new things tech related even when I’ve been working in the web development field for a while. </p>
          <p class = "learning-content"> My future goal is to be able to work remotely from home as I plan to live somewhere away from the cities. I want the luxury of being immersed in nature while still being connected to society. I want to be financially stable as I want to own land and property so that I can plant and bring back native bush wherever I end up at. I want to progress my career to becoming a software developer after working in web development for a while.</p>
