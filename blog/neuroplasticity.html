            <h3 class = "neuro-question">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
            <p class = "neuro-answer">Neuroplasticity is defined as the ability of the brain to form and reorganize synaptic connections, especially in response to learning or experience or following injury. Neuroplasticity benefits people in many ways. It helps our brains adapt and change which promote the ability to learn new things, can enhance our existing cognitive capabilities and help people with the recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries.</p>
       
            <h3 class = "neuro-question">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
            <p class = "neuro-answer">Neuroplasticity works by neurons in our brains making a connection (synapse). For example, say we learn a new instrument, the more we practice that instrument, the stronger the connection between those neurons are made. Consistency creates stronger neural connections. I will use neuroplasticity whenever I am learning something new, like learning programming. I will form better connections within my brain through practice and repetition. </p>
       
            <h3 class = "neuro-question">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p class = "neuro-answer">There are many ways to increase our neuroplasticity. One of the ways is by learning something new like an instrument or a new language. Traveling is also a way of increasing neuroplasticity as it exposes our brains to new environments which open up new pathways and activity in the brain. Regular exercise is also shown to increase neuroplasticity.</p>

            <h3 class = "neuro-question">Link to a resource about neuroplasticity that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
            <p class = "neuro-answer"> <a href = "https://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-scientists-discover-fundamental-rule-of-brain-plasticity-0622">Scientists discover fundamental rule of brain plasticity.</a></p>

            <h3 class = "neuro-question">Discuss what is a growth mindset and why it is relevant</h3>
            <p class = "neuro-answer">According to psychologist Carol Dweck ,“In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment”. Having a growth mindset is important because it can help us overcome obstacles we may face when learning something new or developing a new skill. Growth mindsets understand the importance of persistence and determination. By changing the way we think, we can change the way we learn.</p>
            
            <h3 class = "neuro-question">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
            <p class = "neuro-answer">I already had an idea on what the growth mindset is prior to this exploration so it wasn’t too surprising for me. I am currently changing my perspective and trying to adapt to a growth mindset.</p>

            <h3 class = "neuro-question">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
            <p class = "neuro-answer">I will use the growth mindset by welcoming challenges and persevering through them. I understand that this journey I have started is no easy road, this is why having a growth mindset is so important when learning something new. Determination, perseverance and repetition are key for this journey.</p>
